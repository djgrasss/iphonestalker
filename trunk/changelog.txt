Modifications
- Removed most JOptionPane messages and added a status bar to the GUI.
Clicking this status bar will open the full log.
- Points are now color coded to their confidence level. A confidence of 70 (I
assume is most confident?) is a green icon, whereas a confidence of 1 should
show a yellow icon.

Defects Fixed
- Defect 1: Floating off the west coast of Africa
- Defect 2: Fails to load data for Verizon iPhones
